CSIS 210 Problem Set 4 Fall 2021

Question 1)

  a) The height of the resulting tree is equivalent to the number of nodes that are input since the tree is not balanced out and it is input like a singly-linked list
  
  b) The time complexity for this tree to do a comparison for add operations at the end of the list would be O(n).
  
  c) The best time that would occur for a contains method would be O(1). This would occur when the node is in the first spot that is being checked.
  
  d) The worst time that would occur for a contains method would be O(n). This would occur as in the worst scenarion it will have to go all the way to the end which is equivalent to the number of nodes implemented.
  
  e) If there were n = 10,000,000, it would take 10 milliseconds to do a complete run through on the same computer.
 
Question 2)
  
  a) The height of the tree will be log(n) 
  
  b) The worst case for the number of comparisons needed to perform the contains method will be O(logN)
  
Question  3)
  
  a) it would take 12 microseconds to doa push operation on a stack with 500 elements.
